### Hints

* You may wish to include a `seed.sql` file to pre-populate your database. This will make development of individual features much easier.

* Review the week's activities for a refresher on MySQL.

* Check out [SQL Bolt](https://sqlbolt.com/) for some extra MySQL help.


**Important**: You will be committing a file that contains your database credentials.
